# Configure Wappsto identity for your implementation
For your implementation to identify itself towards Wappsto it needs a network id, the server CA certificate, and the client certificate/key - all generated by Wappsto.

This of course require you to have an account on wappsto.com.

# Generate wappsto_config.h
As a help to generate this you can use the python script included in this repository in the folder generate_config_header. 
For a first time run, you may need to install the required libraries 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
To generate a header file, use the following command - and copy the file wappsto_config.h to your Arduino sketch folder.
```
python3 main.py --type arduino
```

For other commands check the --help parameter.
```
usage: main.py [-h] [--env {dev,qa,stagning,prod}] [--token TOKEN] [--path PATH] --type {c++,c,arduino} [--recreate RECREATE] [--debug]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --env {dev,qa,stagning,prod}
                        Wappsto environment.
  --token TOKEN         The Session Token. If not given, you are prompted to login.
  --path PATH           The location to which save the config file.
  --type {c++,c,arduino}
                        Which programming language the config should be.
  --recreate RECREATE   Recreate Config file, for given network UUID. (Overwrites existent)
  --debug               Make the operation more talkative
